# My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my little corner of coding!

## About This Repository

This repository is all about starting from absolute zero with Python. I’m focusing purely on the basics—no AI, no machine learning, and no fancy frameworks. Just good old-fashioned logic building and problem-solving.

## What's Inside

* **Simple Python Scripts**: You’ll find a bunch of very basic Python files here. Each one is a small example focusing on things like:

  * Variables and data types
  * Basic input and output
  * Loops and conditionals

* **Learning Notes**: Along the way, I’m adding little notes about what I’m discovering as I learn. If you’re also new to coding, these notes might be helpful for you too!

## How to Use This Repo

If you’re a beginner just like me, feel free to explore these files. You can download them, run them on your own computer, and tweak them to see what happens. The whole goal is to get comfortable with the absolute basics of coding.
